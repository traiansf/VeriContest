# Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

You have to check if it is possible to select two or more elements in the array such that their bitwise `OR` has at least one trailing zero in its binary representation.

For example, the binary representation of `5` is `101`, which does not have any trailing zeros, whereas the binary representation of `4` is `100`, which has two trailing zeros.

Return `true` if it is possible to select two or more elements whose bitwise `OR` has trailing zeros, and `false` otherwise.

## Example 1:

> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
> **Output:** true
> **Explanation:** If we select the elements 2 and 4, their bitwise OR is 6, which has binary representation `110` with one trailing zero.

## Example 2:

> **Input:** nums = [2,4,8,16]
> **Output:** true
> **Explanation:** If we select the elements 2 and 4, their bitwise OR is 6, which has binary representation `110` with one trailing zero.

## Example 3:

> **Input:** nums = [1,3,5,7,9]
> **Output:** false
> **Explanation:** There is no way to select two or more elements whose bitwise OR has trailing zeros.

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Starter Code

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn has_trailing_zeros(nums: Vec<i32>) -> bool {
        
    }
}
```
