# Di-visible Confusion

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le |a|$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ is **not** divisible by $$$(i + 1)$$$, and erase this element from the sequence. Here $$$|a|$$$ is the length of sequence $$$a$$$ at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence $$$a$$$ changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.

For example, if $$$a=[3,5,4,5]$$$, then he can select $$$i = 2$$$, because $$$a_2 = 5$$$ is not divisible by $$$i+1 = 3$$$. After this operation the sequence is $$$[3,4,5]$$$.

Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output

For each test case, print "`YES`" (without quotes) if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation, print "`NO`" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any register (upper or lower).

## Example

**Input:**
```
5
3
1 2 3
1
2
2
7 7
10
384836991 191890310 576823355 782177068 404011431 818008580 954291757 160449218 155374934 840594328
8
6 69 696 69696 696969 6969696 69696969 696969696
```
**Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO
```

## Note

In the first test case, YouKn0wWho can perform the following operations (the erased elements are underlined): $$$[1, \underline{2}, 3] \rightarrow [\underline{1}, 3] \rightarrow [\underline{3}] \rightarrow [\,].$$$

In the second test case, it is impossible to erase the sequence as $$$i$$$ can only be $$$1$$$, and when $$$i=1$$$, $$$a_1 = 2$$$ is divisible by $$$i + 1 = 2$$$.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn can_erase_all(a: Vec<i64>) -> bool {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).expect("read input");
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();

    let t: usize = it.next().expect("t").parse().expect("valid t");
    let mut case_id: usize = 0;

    while case_id < t {
        let n: usize = it.next().expect("n").parse().expect("valid n");
        let mut a: Vec<i64> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
        let mut i: usize = 0;
        while i < n {
            a.push(it.next().expect("a_i").parse().expect("valid a_i"));
            i = i + 1;
        }

        if Solution::can_erase_all(a) {
            println!("YES");
        } else {
            println!("NO");
        }

        case_id = case_id + 1;
    }
}
```
