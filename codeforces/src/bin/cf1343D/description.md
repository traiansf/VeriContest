# Constant Palindrome Sum

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers (it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is even, i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$). All $$$a_i$$$ does not exceed some integer $$$k$$$.

Your task is to replace the **minimum** number of elements (replacement is the following operation: choose some index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and replace $$$a_i$$$ with some integer in range $$$[1; k]$$$) to satisfy the following conditions:
 - after all replacements, all $$$a_i$$$ are positive integers not greater than $$$k$$$; 
- for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ the following equation is true: $$$a_i + a_{n - i + 1} = x$$$, where $$$x$$$ should be **the same** for all $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ pairs of elements. 

You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and the maximum possible value of some $$$a_i$$$ correspondingly. It is guratanteed that $$$n$$$ is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$). The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le k$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ (as well as the sum of $$$k$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$\sum k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer — the **minimum** number of elements you have to replace in $$$a$$$ to satisfy the conditions from the problem statement.

## Example

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead, Write, BufWriter};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn constant_palindrome_sum(n: usize, k: i64, a: Vec<i64>) -> i64 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let stdout = io::stdout();
    let mut out = BufWriter::new(stdout.lock());
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();

    let t: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().trim().parse().unwrap();
    for _ in 0..t {
        let nk: Vec<usize> = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().split_whitespace()
            .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap()).collect();
        let n = nk[0];
        let k = nk[1] as i64;
        let a: Vec<i64> = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().split_whitespace()
            .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap()).collect();
        let ans = Solution::constant_palindrome_sum(n, k, a);
        writeln!(out, "{}", ans).unwrap();
    }
}
```
