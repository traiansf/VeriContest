# Almost Equal

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

You are given integer $$$n$$$. You have to arrange numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied:

For every $$$n$$$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $$$2n$$$ numbers differ not more than by $$$1$$$.

For example, choose $$$n = 3$$$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $$$1 + 4 + 5 = 10$$$, $$$4 + 5 + 2 = 11$$$, $$$5 + 2 + 3 = 10$$$, $$$2 + 3 + 6 = 11$$$, $$$3 + 6 + 1 = 10$$$, $$$6 + 1 + 4 = 11$$$, any two numbers differ by at most $$$1$$$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $$$5 + 1 + 6 = 12$$$, and $$$3 + 2 + 4 = 9$$$, $$$9$$$ and $$$12$$$ differ more than by $$$1$$$.

## Input

The first and the only line contain one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).

## Output

If there is no solution, output "`NO`" in the first line. 

If there is a solution, output "`YES`" in the first line. In the second line output $$$2n$$$ numbers — numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ in the order they will stay in the circle. Each number should appear only once. If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
3
```
**Output:**
```
YES
1 4 5 2 3 6
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
4
```
**Output:**
```
NO
```

## Note

Example from the statement is shown for the first example. 

It can be proved that there is no solution in the second example.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn almost_equal(n: usize) -> Vec<i64> {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let n: usize = input.trim().parse().unwrap();
    let res = Solution::almost_equal(n);
    if res.is_empty() {
        println!("NO");
    } else {
        println!("YES");
        let parts: Vec<String> = res.iter().map(|x| x.to_string()).collect();
        println!("{}", parts.join(" "));
    }
}
```
