# Dreamoon and Sets

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

Dreamoon likes to play with sets, integers and .  is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$.

Let $S$ be a set of exactly four distinct integers greater than $0$. Define $S$ to be of rank $k$ if and only if for all pairs of distinct elements $s_i$, $s_j$ from $S$, .

Given $k$ and $n$, Dreamoon wants to make up $n$ sets of rank $k$ using integers from $1$ to $m$ such that no integer is used in two different sets (of course you can leave some integers without use). Calculate the minimum $m$ that makes it possible and print one possible solution.

## Input

The single line of the input contains two space separated integers $n$, $k$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100$).

## Output

On the first line print a single integer — the minimal possible $m$. 

On each of the next $n$ lines print four space separated integers representing the $i$-th set.

Neither the order of the sets nor the order of integers within a set is important. If there are multiple possible solutions with minimal $m$, print any one of them.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
1 1
```
**Output:**
```
5
1 2 3 5
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
2 2
```
**Output:**
```
22
2 4 6 22
14 18 10 16
```

## Note

For the first example it's easy to see that set ${1, 2, 3, 4}$ isn't a valid set of rank 1 since .

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn build_dreamoon_sets(n: usize, k: i32) -> Vec<Vec<i32>> {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
    let mut parts = line.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let k: i32 = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let m = k * (6 * n as i32 - 1);
    let sets = Solution::build_dreamoon_sets(n, k);
    println!("{}", m);
    let mut idx: usize = 0;
    while idx < sets.len() {
        let row = &sets[idx];
        println!("{} {} {} {}", row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3]);
        idx = idx + 1;
    }
}
```
