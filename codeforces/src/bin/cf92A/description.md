# Chips

Time limit: 2 seconds | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

There are $n$ walruses sitting in a circle. All of them are numbered in the clockwise order: the walrus number $2$ sits to the left of the walrus number $1$, the walrus number $3$ sits to the left of the walrus number $2$, ..., the walrus number $1$ sits to the left of the walrus number $n$.

The presenter has $m$ chips. The presenter stands in the middle of the circle and starts giving the chips to the walruses starting from walrus number $1$ and moving clockwise. The walrus number $i$ gets $i$ chips. If the presenter can't give the current walrus the required number of chips, then the presenter takes the remaining chips and the process ends. Determine by the given $n$ and $m$ how many chips the presenter will get in the end.

## Input

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 50$, $1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4$) — the number of walruses and the number of chips correspondingly.

## Output

Print the number of chips the presenter ended up with.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
4 11
```
**Output:**
```
0
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
17 107
```
**Output:**
```
2
```

### Example 3

**Input:**
```
3 8
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

## Note

In the first sample the presenter gives one chip to the walrus number $1$, two chips to the walrus number $2$, three chips to the walrus number $3$, four chips to the walrus number $4$, then again one chip to the walrus number $1$. After that the presenter runs out of chips. He can't give anything to the walrus number $2$ and the process finishes.

In the third sample the presenter gives one chip to the walrus number $1$, two chips to the walrus number $2$, three chips to the walrus number $3$, then again one chip to the walrus number $1$. The presenter has one chip left and he can't give two chips to the walrus number $2$, that's why the presenter takes the last chip.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read, Write, BufWriter};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn presenter_chips(n: u32, m: u32) -> u32 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let stdout = io::stdout();
    let mut out = BufWriter::new(stdout.lock());
    let mut iter = input.split_ascii_whitespace();
    let n: u32 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let m: u32 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    writeln!(out, "{}", Solution::presenter_chips(n, m)).unwrap();
}
```
