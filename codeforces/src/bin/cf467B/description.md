# Fedor and New Game

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

After you had helped George and Alex to move in the dorm, they went to help their friend Fedor play a new computer game «Call of Soldiers 3».

The game has $(m + 1)$ players and $n$ types of soldiers in total. Players «Call of Soldiers 3» are numbered form $1$ to $(m + 1)$. Types of soldiers are numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. Each player has an army. Army of the $i$-th player can be described by non-negative integer $x_i$. Consider binary representation of $x_i$: if the $j$-th bit of number $x_i$ equal to one, then the army of the $i$-th player has soldiers of the $j$-th type. 

Fedor is the $(m + 1)$-th player of the game. He assume that two players can become friends if their armies differ in at most $k$ types of soldiers (in other words, binary representations of the corresponding numbers differ in at most $k$ bits). Help Fedor and count how many players can become his friends.

## Input

The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ $(1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 20; 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000)$.

The $i$-th of the next $(m + 1)$ lines contains a single integer $x_i$ $(1 ≤ x_i ≤ 2^n - 1)$, that describes the $i$-th player's army. We remind you that Fedor is the $(m + 1)$-th player.

## Output

Print a single integer — the number of Fedor's potential friends.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn count_fedor_friends(n: i32, k: i32, armies: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).expect("read input");
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: i32 = it.next().expect("n").parse().expect("n");
    let m_in: usize = it.next().expect("m").parse().expect("m");
    let k: i32 = it.next().expect("k").parse().expect("k");
    let mut armies: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let mut j: usize = 0;
    while j < m_in + 1 {
        let v: i32 = it.next().expect("x").parse().expect("x");
        armies.push(v);
        j = j + 1;
    }
    let ans = Solution::count_fedor_friends(n, k, armies);
    println!("{}", ans);
}
