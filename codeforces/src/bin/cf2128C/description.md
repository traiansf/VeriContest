# Leftmost Below

Time limit: 2 seconds | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

Consider an array $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$. Initially, $$$a_i = 0$$$ for every $$$i$$$.

You can do operations of the following form. 
 - You choose an integer $$$x$$$ greater than $$$\min(a)$$$. 
- Then, $$$i$$$ is defined as the minimum index such that $$$a_i  \lt  x$$$. In other words, $$$i$$$ is the unique integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive such that $$$a_i  \lt  x$$$ and $$$a_j \geq x$$$ for every $$$1 \leq j \leq i-1$$$. 
- Finally, $$$a_i$$$ is incremented by $$$x$$$. 

For example, if $$$a = [6, 8, 2, 1]$$$ and you choose $$$x = 6$$$, then $$$i$$$ will be equal to $$$3$$$ (since $$$a_1 \geq 6$$$, $$$a_2 \geq 6$$$, and $$$a_3  \lt  6$$$) and $$$a$$$ will become $$$[6, 8, 8, 1]$$$.

You can do as many operations as you want. Can you reach a target array $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$?

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\,000$$$.

## Output

For each test case, print `YES` if you can reach the target array and `NO` otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will be recognized as positive responses.

## Example

**Input:**
```
4
4
5 6 1 1
3
3 1 2
3
40 60 90
2
1 1
```
**Output:**
```
YES
NO
NO
YES
```

## Note

In the first test case, we can do the following sequence of operations: 
 - we choose $$$x=2$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 0, 0, 0]$$$ 
- we choose $$$x=2$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 2, 0, 0]$$$ 
- we choose $$$x=3$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, 2, 0, 0]$$$ 
- we choose $$$x=4$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, 6, 0, 0]$$$ 
- we choose $$$x=1$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, 6, 1, 0]$$$ 
- we choose $$$x=1$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, 6, 1, 1]$$$ 

In the second test case, we can prove there is no way to reach $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn leftmost_below(n: usize, b: Vec<i64>) -> bool {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let t_line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
    let t: usize = t_line.trim().parse().unwrap();
    let mut out = String::new();
    for _ in 0..t {
        let n_line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        let n: usize = n_line.trim().parse().unwrap();
        let b_line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        let mut b: Vec<i64> = Vec::new();
        for part in b_line.split_whitespace() {
            b.push(part.parse().unwrap());
        }
        let ok = Solution::leftmost_below(n, b);
        if ok {
            out.push_str("YES\n");
        } else {
            out.push_str("NO\n");
        }
    }
    print!("{}", out);
}
```
