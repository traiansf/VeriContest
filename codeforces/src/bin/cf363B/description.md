# Fence

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

There is a fence in front of Polycarpus's home. The fence consists of $n$ planks of the same width which go one after another from left to right. The height of the $i$-th plank is $h_i$ meters, distinct planks can have distinct heights.
    Fence for $n = 7$ and $h = [1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 7, 1]$ 
Polycarpus has bought a posh piano and is thinking about how to get it into the house. In order to carry out his plan, he needs to take exactly $k$ consecutive planks from the fence. Higher planks are harder to tear off the fence, so Polycarpus wants to find such $k$ consecutive planks that the sum of their heights is minimal possible.

Write the program that finds the indexes of $k$ consecutive planks with minimal total height. Pay attention, the fence is not around Polycarpus's home, it is in front of home (in other words, the fence isn't cyclic).

## Input

The first line of the input contains integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 1.5·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n$) — the number of planks in the fence and the width of the hole for the piano. The second line contains the sequence of integers $h_1, h_2, ..., h_n$ ($1 ≤ h_i ≤ 100$), where $h_i$ is the height of the $i$-th plank of the fence.

## Output

Print such integer $j$ that the sum of the heights of planks $j$, $j + 1$, ..., $j + k - 1$ is the minimum possible. If there are multiple such $j$'s, print any of them.

## Example

**Input:**
```
7 3
1 2 6 1 1 7 1
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

## Note

In the sample, your task is to find three consecutive planks with the minimum sum of heights. In the given case three planks with indexes 3, 4 and 5 have the required attribute, their total height is 8.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn min_sum_window_start(heights: Vec<i32>, k: usize) -> usize {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let k: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut heights: Vec<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
    let mut i: usize = 0;
    while i < n {
        heights.push(it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap());
        i += 1;
    }
    let answer = Solution::min_sum_window_start(heights, k);
    println!("{}", answer);
}
```
