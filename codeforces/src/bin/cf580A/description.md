# Kefa and First Steps

Time limit: 2 seconds | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly $n$ days. He knows that on the $i$-th day ($1 ≤ i ≤ n$) he makes $a_i$ money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence $a_i$. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!

## Input

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,  a_2,  ...,  a_n$ ($1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9$).

## Output

Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence $a$.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
6
2 2 1 3 4 1
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
3
2 2 9
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

## Note

In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.

In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn longest_non_decreasing_run(a: Vec<i64>) -> usize {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let n: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().trim().parse().unwrap();
    let line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
    let mut a: Vec<i64> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
    for s in line.split_whitespace() {
        a.push(s.parse().unwrap());
    }
    let ans = Solution::longest_non_decreasing_run(a);
    println!("{}", ans);
}
```
