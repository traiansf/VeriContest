# Elephant

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point $0$ and his friend's house is located at point $x(x > 0)$ of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ or $5$ positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer $x$ ($1 ≤ x ≤ 1 000 000$) — The coordinate of the friend's house.

## Output

Print the minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to get from point $0$ to point $x$.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
5
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
12
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

## Note

In the first sample the elephant needs to make one step of length $5$ to reach the point $x$.

In the second sample the elephant can get to point $x$ if he moves by $3$, $5$ and $4$. There are other ways to get the optimal answer but the elephant cannot reach $x$ in less than three moves.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io;

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn min_steps(x: u64) -> u64 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut line = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut line).expect("read line");
    let x: u64 = line.trim().parse().expect("integer");
    println!("{}", Solution::min_steps(x));
}
```
