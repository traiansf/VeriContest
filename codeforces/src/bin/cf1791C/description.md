Timur initially had a binary string$$$^{\dagger}$$$ $$$s$$$ (possibly of length $$$0$$$). He performed the following operation several (possibly zero) times: 
 - Add $$$\texttt{0}$$$ to one end of the string and $$$\texttt{1}$$$ to the other end of the string. For example, starting from the string $$$\texttt{1011}$$$, you can obtain either $$$\color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{1011}\color{red}{\texttt{1}}$$$ or $$$\color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{1011}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$. 
 You are given Timur's final string. What is the length of the **shortest** possible string he could have started with?
$$$^{\dagger}$$$ A binary string is a string (possibly the empty string) whose characters are either $$$\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\texttt{1}$$$.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2000$$$) — the length of Timur's final string.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\texttt{1}$$$, denoting the final string.

## Output

For each test case, output a single nonnegative integer — the shortest possible length of Timur's original string. Note that Timur's original string could have been empty, in which case you should output $$$0$$$.

## Example

**Input:**
```
9
3
100
4
0111
5
10101
6
101010
7
1010110
1
1
2
10

11

1011011010
```
**Output:**
```
1

0

```

## Note

In the first test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{0}$$$, and he performed the following operation: $$$\texttt{0} \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{0}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.

In the second test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{11}$$$, and he performed the following operation: $$$\texttt{11} \to \color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{11}\color{red}{\texttt{1}}$$$.

In the third test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{10101}$$$, and he didn't perform any operations.

In the fourth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is the empty string (which we denote by $$$\varepsilon$$$), and he performed the following operations: $$$\varepsilon \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{}\color{red}{\texttt{0}} \to \color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{10}\color{red}{\texttt{1}} \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{0101}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.

In the fifth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{101}$$$, and he performed the following operations: $$$\texttt{101} \to \color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{101}\color{red}{\texttt{1}} \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{01011}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn shortest_original(n: usize, s: Vec<i64>) -> usize {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let t: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut i: usize = 0;
    while i < t {
        let n: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let line: &str = it.next().unwrap();
        let bytes = line.as_bytes();
        let mut s: Vec<i64> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
        let mut j: usize = 0;
        while j < n {
            s.push((bytes[j] - b'0') as i64);
            j += 1;
        }
        let answer = Solution::shortest_original(n, s);
        println!("{}", answer);
        i += 1;
    }
}
```
