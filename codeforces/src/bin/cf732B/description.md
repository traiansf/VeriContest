# Cormen — The Best Friend Of a Man

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

Recently a dog was bought for Polycarp. The dog's name is Cormen. Now Polycarp has a lot of troubles. For example, Cormen likes going for a walk. 

Empirically Polycarp learned that the dog needs at least $k$ walks for any two consecutive days in order to feel good. For example, if $k = 5$ and yesterday Polycarp went for a walk with Cormen $2$ times, today he has to go for a walk at least $3$ times. 

Polycarp analysed all his affairs over the next $n$ days and made a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of times Polycarp will walk with the dog on the $i$-th day while doing all his affairs (for example, he has to go to a shop, throw out the trash, etc.).

Help Polycarp determine the minimum number of walks he needs to do additionaly in the next $n$ days so that Cormen will feel good during all the $n$ days. You can assume that on the day before the first day and on the day after the $n$-th day Polycarp will go for a walk with Cormen exactly $k$ times. 

Write a program that will find the minumum number of additional walks and the appropriate schedule — the sequence of integers $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ ($b_i ≥ a_i$), where $b_i$ means the total number of walks with the dog on the $i$-th day.

## Input

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 ≤ n, k ≤ 500$) — the number of days and the minimum number of walks with Cormen for any two consecutive days. 

The second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ ($0 ≤ a_i ≤ 500$) — the number of walks with Cormen on the $i$-th day which Polycarp has already planned.

## Output

In the first line print the smallest number of additional walks that Polycarp should do during the next $n$ days so that Cormen will feel good during all days. 

In the second line print $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, where $b_i$ — the total number of walks on the $i$-th day according to the found solutions ($a_i ≤ b_i$ for all $i$ from 1 to $n$). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

```rust

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn cormen_walk_schedule(a: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> (i64, Vec<i32>) {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let k: i32 = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut a: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let mut j: usize = 0;
    while j < n {
        let x: i32 = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        a.push(x);
        j = j + 1;
    }
    let (total, b) = Solution::cormen_walk_schedule(a, k);
    println!("{}", total);
    let mut t: usize = 0;
    while t < b.len() {
        if t > 0 {
            print!(" ");
        }
        print!("{}", b[t]);
        t = t + 1;
    }
    println!();
}
