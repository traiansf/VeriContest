# Lunch Rush

Time limit: 2 seconds | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

Having written another programming contest, three Rabbits decided to grab some lunch. The coach gave the team exactly $k$ time units for the lunch break.

The Rabbits have a list of $n$ restaurants to lunch in: the $i$-th restaurant is characterized by two integers $f_i$ and $t_i$. Value $t_i$ shows the time the Rabbits need to lunch in the $i$-th restaurant. If time $t_i$ exceeds the time $k$ that the coach has given for the lunch break, then the Rabbits' joy from lunching in this restaurant will equal $f_i - (t_i - k)$. Otherwise, the Rabbits get exactly $f_i$ units of joy.

Your task is to find the value of the maximum joy the Rabbits can get from the lunch, depending on the restaurant. The Rabbits must choose **exactly** one restaurant to lunch in. Note that the joy value isn't necessarily a positive value.

## Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers — $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4$) and $k$ ($1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9$) — the number of restaurants in the Rabbits' list and the time the coach has given them to lunch, correspondingly. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers — $f_i$ ($1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9$) and $t_i$ ($1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^9$) — the characteristics of the $i$-th restaurant.

## Output

In a single line print a single integer — the maximum joy value that the Rabbits will get from the lunch.

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn max_lunch_joy(restaurants: Vec<(i64, i64)>, k: i64) -> i64 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let k: i64 = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut restaurants: Vec<(i64, i64)> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
    let mut i: usize = 0;
    while i < n {
        let f: i64 = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let t: i64 = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        restaurants.push((f, t));
        i = i + 1;
    }
    let answer = Solution::max_lunch_joy(restaurants, k);
    println!("{}", answer);
