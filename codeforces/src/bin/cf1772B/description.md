# Matrix Rotation

Time limit: 2 seconds | Memory limit: 512 megabytes

You have a matrix $$$2 \times 2$$$ filled with **distinct** integers. You want your matrix to become beautiful. The matrix is beautiful if the following two conditions are satisfied:
 - in each row, the first element is smaller than the second element; 
- in each column, the first element is smaller than the second element. 
  
You can perform the following operation on the matrix any number of times: rotate it clockwise by $$$90$$$ degrees, so the top left element shifts to the top right cell, the top right element shifts to the bottom right cell, and so on:
  
Determine if it is possible to make the matrix beautiful by applying zero or more operations.

## Input

The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. Each of those lines contains two integers — the elements of the corresponding row of the matrix. In each matrix, all four elements are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$.

## Output

For each test case, print `YES` if the matrix can become beautiful, or `NO` otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (`YES`, `yes`, `Yes` will all be recognized as positive answer, `NO`, `no` and `nO` will all be recognized as negative answer).

## Example

**Input:**
```
6
1 3
5 7
8 10
3 4
8 10
4 3
6 1
9 2
7 5
4 2
1 2
4 3
```
**Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO
```

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn can_make_beautiful(a: i32, b: i32, c: i32, d: i32) -> bool {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    if let Some(Ok(t_str)) = lines.next() {
        if let Ok(t) = t_str.trim().parse::<usize>() {
            let mut tc: usize = 0;
            while tc < t {
                if let Some(Ok(row1)) = lines.next() {
                    if let Some(Ok(row2)) = lines.next() {
                        let r1: Vec<i32> = row1.split_whitespace().map(|x| x.parse().unwrap()).collect();
                        let r2: Vec<i32> = row2.split_whitespace().map(|x| x.parse().unwrap()).collect();
                        if r1.len() >= 2 && r2.len() >= 2 {
                            let a = r1[0];
                            let b = r1[1];
                            let c = r2[0];
                            let d = r2[1];
                            if Solution::can_make_beautiful(a, b, c, d) {
                                println!("YES");
                            } else {
                                println!("NO");
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                tc += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
