# Unique Bid Auction

Time limit: 1 second | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

There is a game called "Unique Bid Auction". You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction (though you don't have to do it to solve this problem).

Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are $$$n$$$ participants, the $$$i$$$-th participant chose the number $$$a_i$$$. The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose is **unique** (i. e. nobody else chose this number except him) and is **minimal** (i. e. among all unique values of $$$a$$$ the minimum one is the winning one).

Your task is to find the **index** of the participant who won the game (or `-1` if there is no winner). Indexing is $$$1$$$-based, i. e. the participants are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of participants. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th participant chosen number.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer — the **index** of the participant who won the game (or `-1` if there is no winner). **Note that the answer is always unique**.

## Example

**Input:**
```

5
2 3 2 4 2
6
1 1 5 5 4 4
```
**Output:**
```
-1

-1
```

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn unique_bid_winner(a: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let t: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut k = 0usize;
    while k < t {
        let n: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let mut a: Vec<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
        let mut i = 0usize;
        while i < n {
            a.push(it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap());
            i += 1;
        }
        let ans = Solution::unique_bid_winner(a);
        println!("{}", ans);
        k += 1;
    }
}
```
