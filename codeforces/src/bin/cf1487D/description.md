# Pythagorean Triples

Time limit: 2 seconds | Memory limit: 256 megabytes

A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers $$$(a, b, c)$$$ such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is $$$(3, 4, 5)$$$.

Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: $$$c = a^2 - b$$$.

Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple $$$(3, 4, 5)$$$: $$$5 = 3^2 - 4$$$, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple.

When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers $$$(a, b, c)$$$ with $$$1 \le a \le b \le c \le n$$$ such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.

## Input

The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$).

## Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of triples of integers $$$(a, b, c)$$$ with $$$1 \le a \le b \le c \le n$$$ such that they are Pythagorean according both to the real definition and to the formula Vasya came up with.

## Example

**Input:**
```
3
3
6
9
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
1
```

## Note

The only Pythagorean triple satisfying $$$c = a^2 - b$$$ with $$$1 \le a \le b \le c \le 9$$$ is $$$(3, 4, 5)$$$; that's why the answer for $$$n = 3$$$ is $$$0$$$, and the answer for $$$n = 6$$$ (and for $$$n = 9$$$) is $$$1$$$.

## Starter Code

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn vasya_pythagorean_triples_count(n: u64) -> u64 {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut it = input.split_whitespace();
    let t: usize = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut i: usize = 0;
    while i < t {
        let n: u64 = it.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let answer = Solution::vasya_pythagorean_triples_count(n);
        println!("{}", answer);
        i += 1;
    }
}
```
